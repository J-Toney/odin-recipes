This is the first project I have done with the course "The Odin Project."
In this project, I demonstrate my knowledge of creating initial boilerplate code which includes DOCTYPE, <html>, <head> and <body>.
Additionally I demonstrate my knowledge on
unordered and ordered lists
adding images and adding alt text to them
adding links with relative paths
