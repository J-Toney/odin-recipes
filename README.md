This is the first project I have done with the course "The Odin Project."
In this project, I demonstrate my knowledge of creating initial boilerplate code which includes DOCTYPE, <html>, <head> and <body>.

In <html> I set the language to English.
In <head> I add meta data with <meta charset="UT-8"> and title the webpage with <title>
In <body> I add unordered and ordered lists, added images with alt text, and added relative paths connecting the three pages to the index both ways
