This is the first project I have done with the course "The Odin Project."

In this project, I demonstrate my knowledge of creating initial boilerplate code which includes DOCTYPE, html, head and body.

I set the language the browser reads site in to English.
I added meta data with meta charset="UT-8" and title the webpage with <title>
I added unordered and ordered lists, added images with alt text, and added relative paths connecting the three pages to the index both ways
