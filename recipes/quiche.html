        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p>Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated crustless quiche:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs: Because this quiche doesn't have a crust, you'll need five eggs to hold the mixture together.</li>
            <li>Spinach: Frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) works best, but you can use fresh spinach if that's all you have on hand.</li>
            <li>Onion: A yellow or white onion adds a depth of flavor to the quiche.</li>
            <li>Muenster Cheese: Muenster is a mild cheese that melts well and will add a delicious flavor cheesy to the quiche.</li>
            <li>Spices: Simple salt and pepper is all you need.</li>
