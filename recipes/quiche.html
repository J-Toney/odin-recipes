        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This crustless quiche made with eggs, spinach, and Muenster cheese is perfect to serve at any meal. With no crust to bake, this light-tasting quiche is ready to serve in under an hour.</p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p>Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated crustless quiche:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs: Because this quiche doesn't have a crust, you'll need five eggs to hold the mixture together.</li>
            <li>Spinach: Frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) works best, but you can use fresh spinach if that's all you have on hand.</li>
            <li>Onion: A yellow or white onion adds a depth of flavor to the quiche.</li>
            <li>Muenster Cheese: Muenster is a mild cheese that melts well and will add a delicious flavor cheesy to the quiche.</li>
            <li>Spices: Simple salt and pepper is all you need.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch pie pan.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in spinach and continue to cook until excess moisture has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Whisk together eggs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add Muenster cheese and spinach mixture and stir until well blended.</li>
            <li>Pour into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until eggs have set, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
